/**
 * Sometimes, the value of a field is non-trivial to load. This might involve database lookups, complex calculations, or anything else.
 * GraphQL Tools has a concept of a field resolver that is used for this purpose. These are Spring beans that can provide values in place of the data bean.
 *
 * The field resolver is any bean in the Spring Context that has the same name as the data bean, with the suffix Resolver, and that implements the GraphQLResolver interface.
 * Methods on the field resolver bean follow all of the same rules as on the data bean but are also provided the data bean itself as a first parameter.
 *
 * If a field resolver and the data bean both have methods for the same GraphQL field then the field resolver will take precedence.
 *
 * The fact that these field resolvers are loaded from the Spring context is important. This allows them to work with any other Spring managed beans â€“ e.g., DAOs.
 *
 * Importantly, if the client does not request a field, then the GraphQL Server will never do the work to retrieve it.
 * This means that if a client retrieves a Post and does not ask for the Author, then the getAuthor() method above will never be executed, and the DAO call will never be made.
