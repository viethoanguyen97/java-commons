#The one requirement is that there must be exactly one root query, and up to one root mutation.
#This can not be split across files, unlike the rest of the scheme. This is a limitation of the GraphQL Schema definition itself, and not of the Java implementation.

# The Root Query for the application
type Query {
    recentPosts(count: Int, offset: Int): [Post]!
    vehicles(count: Int): [Vehicle]
    vehicle(id: ID): Vehicle
}

# The Root Mutation for the application
type Mutation {
    writePost(title: String!, text: String!, category: String, author: String!) : Post!
    createVehicle(type: String!, modelCode: String!, brandName: String, launchDate: String): Vehicle!
}
